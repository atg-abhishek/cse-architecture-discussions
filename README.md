# cse-architecture-discussions
This repo contains our CSE team reviews and discussions on architectures from AOSA http://aosabook.org/en/index.html

## Purpose 

This will serve as a place to get into a cadence of discussing architecture with the following goals: 

1. Improve our skills in designing scalable, maintainable, extensible code that follows good engineering fundamentals. 
2. Learn from a wide selection of successful open-source projects to surface a variety of best practices.
3. Help early-career engineers gain experience and insights through peer discussions with senior team members. 

## Format 

Weekly calls where everyone goes through a single reading that is agreed upon in the previous week from the AOSA series 

1. One person will be responsible for filling out the [template](Template.md) 
2. During the call, notes will be added to the template document via PRs 

## Long-run goals

1. There might be *meta-patterns* that emerge from the discussions over time and we can surface those in new files on the repo


## Contribution Guidelines

Suggestions and improvements are always welcome, please feel free to refer to the [contributions document](Contributing.md)
